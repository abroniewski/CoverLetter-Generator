# README Authoring Rules (Public Repos)

## Primary goal
Write a README that works for:
1) A decision maker skimming in 20 seconds.
2) A developer wanting to run or evaluate the project.

Optimise for clarity, credibility, and concrete outcomes. Avoid fluff.

## Voice and formatting
- Use UK English spelling.
- No em dashes. Use periods, commas, or semicolons.
- Short paragraphs. Use headings and bullets. Avoid walls of text.
- Prefer specific nouns over buzzwords.
- If something is a PoC, demo, internal tool, or archived, say so plainly.

## Required README sections (in this order)
Always include these sections unless the project truly cannot support them. If a section is not applicable, include it with a brief note.

1. **Project Name**
   - Title matches repo name.
   - Add badges only if meaningful (CI, licence). Do not add vanity badges.

2. **One-line summary**
   - One sentence: what it is, who it is for, and why it exists.

3. **The Problem**
   - 2 to 6 bullets describing the real-world pain or constraint.
   - Mention why common alternatives were insufficient (one line).

4. **The Approach**
   - Explain at system level using:
     - Inputs
     - Processing
     - Outputs
   - Avoid deep implementation details.

5. **Demo**
   - Prefer: GIF or screenshot.
   - If a live demo exists, link it.
   - If no visuals exist, include a short "What you would see" description.

6. **Value Delivered**
   - 2 to 5 bullets.
   - Quantify when possible (time saved, cost avoided, accuracy improved).
   - If estimates are used, label them as estimates and state the assumption.

7. **Scope & Status**
   - Project type: Production / Internal Tool / PoC / Demo / Research / Archived
   - Current state: Active / Paused / Archived
   - Known limitations: 2 to 5 bullets
   - Explicitly state what this project does not attempt to solve.

8. **Tech Stack**
   - Short list: frontend, backend, data, infra, AI/ML libraries.
   - Keep it to what is actually used in this repo.

9. **Getting Started**
   - Only include runnable steps that work.
   - Include prerequisites (runtime, package manager, external services).
   - Provide a minimal install + first run path.
   - Prefer copy-paste commands.

10. **Usage**
   - Show common commands and example invocations.
   - If there is a CLI, show 2 to 4 core examples.
   - If there is an API, show a minimal request and response shape.

11. **Configuration**
   - Document required env vars and defaults.
   - Provide a `.env.example` reference if it exists.
   - Never include secrets.

12. **Project Structure (optional)**
   - Include only if the repo is non-trivial.
   - Provide a short tree and a one-line explanation per folder.

13. **Testing**
   - Show how to run tests.
   - If tests do not exist, say: "Tests: not implemented" and optionally list next-step intentions.

14. **Roadmap**
   - 3 to 8 bullets max.
   - Separate "Next" from "Later".
   - If not actively maintained, explicitly say so and keep this section short.

15. **License**
   - State SPDX name and link to LICENSE.

16. **Credits / Acknowledgements**
   - Mention major dependencies, datasets, inspirations, or upstream forks.
   - If forked, state what changed.

17. **Contact / Support**
   - How to open issues.
   - Optional: contact email or website link.

## Content rules
- Use concrete examples specific to this project.
- Do not invent metrics, clients, or results.
- Do not claim production use unless confirmed in the repo context.
- If the repo is part of a larger system, add a short "Related Work" list with links to sibling repos.

## When updating an existing README
- Preserve useful content. Rewrite only what is unclear, outdated, or inconsistent with these rules.
- Fix typos and formatting.
- Ensure the top of the README communicates purpose before installation.

## Output expectations
- Produce a complete README.md, not a draft outline.
- Include at least one Demo asset placeholder if none exists:
  - "Add screenshot: docs/images/demo.png"
- Keep the full README concise:
  - Target 60 to 180 lines for most repos.
