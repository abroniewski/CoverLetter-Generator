Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Lean Agile Portfolio Manager position advertised on your website. With 10 years of experience managing multiple Product creation/Engineering/Software/Technology Delivery projects and a proven track record of managing cross-functional teams in large Enterprise environments, I believe that my skills and experience make me a strong fit for this position.

I negotiated with contractors, built execution strategies, and contingency plans to balance cost, schedule, and operational risk. I used Agile PM to increase team efficiency by 77%, implemented rapid feedback, and accountability systems to cultivate continuous improvement and adopted the Kanban method to manage work, pursue incremental change, and focus on customer needs. I also mentored, coached, and trained 35 staff while supporting their role maturity and professional career development.

Moreover, as a member of Avatar Innovations - Venture Capital program, I ideated to find creative ways to use data analytics to support the energy industry's transition to renewable energies. I developed a business plan for a digital energy trading platform for consideration by a venture capital group to move to the accelerator round.

As the Lean Agile Portfolio Manager, I will provide oversight to portfolio level value-driven governance for Agile delivery across the Technology streams. I will play a crucial role in ensuring that all Technology portfolio investments are aligned to the Airports', Post & Parcel, or Warehouse business strategies and meet short/long term business needs and value expectations. I will also monitor Portfolio-level Delivery and provide Value Risk Oversight by partnering with various stakeholders to define, analyze, and report out on portfolio-level technology and business risks, metrics, and information related to value delivery.
